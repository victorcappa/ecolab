<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> 
  I was happy to be a part on the history of this amazing company by creating a real celebration â€“ confetti, balloons and a LOT of movement. The main objective was to provide a select group of clients with an immersive Augmented Reality experience that not only allowed them to celebrate but also offered a glimpse into the innovative capabilities of GS using this immersive technology.

  <h3>Challenges</h3
   <p>
In one word: performance. It's no secret that webAR is still in its infancy when it comes to delivering a seamless user experience. However, when you add 3D models, animations, and real-time interactivity with the environment, including shadows and lights, it becomes an even greater challenge. This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to dive deep into performance optimization strategies. I focused on efficient model compression techniques,texture optimization, and code optimization to ensure smooth and responsive AR experiences.
